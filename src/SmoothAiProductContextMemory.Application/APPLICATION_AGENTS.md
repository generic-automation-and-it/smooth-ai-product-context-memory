# APPLICATION_AGENTS.md

## TL;DR

Vertical-slice use cases dispatched via the Mediator source generator — one folder per feature under `Features/`, never a horizontal `Commands/`/`Queries/` split.

## Non-Negotiables

- **No `Commands/` or `Queries/` folders.** Each use case lives in `Features/<FeatureName>/` with its request, response, validator, and handler colocated.
- **No domain logic here.** Application orchestrates Domain and infrastructure abstractions; business rules live in Domain.
- **Define infrastructure contracts as interfaces here.** Persistence store contracts go in `Common/Persistence/`, external client contracts in `Common/Clients/`. Application depends on `IFoo`, never on an Infrastructure concrete type.
- **Use `Mediator` (martinothamar), not `MediatR`.** Register handlers as `Scoped` (`MediatorOptions.ServiceLifetime = ServiceLifetime.Scoped`) so they can consume scoped collaborators such as `IApplicationDbContext`; the generator defaults to Singleton, which fails DI scope validation.
- **FluentValidation runs fail-fast** in a Mediator pipeline behavior under `Common/Pipelines/`, before the handler.
- **References Domain only** — never Infrastructure or Host.
- **Persistence contract is `IApplicationDbContext`**, not the Infrastructure DbContext. Seven `DbSet`s only; never map `label_usage` as an entity.

## Slice shape (`Features/<Name>/<UseCase>.cs`)

```text

      ├ Response
      ├ Validator  : AbstractValidator<Request>
      └ Handler    : IRequestHandler<Request, Response>
```
